# ChatGPT-System-Prompts

A personal collection of system prompts I've developed to support specific learning and communication goals. These represent my iterative attempts at optimizing AI interactions rather than definitive solutions.

## Current Prompts

### Helper Specifics (`helper-specifics.txt`)

A prompt designed to encourage step-by-step debugging and constructive feedback. Rather than providing complete solutions upfront, this prompt guides ChatGPT to:

- Break down debugging into manageable steps
- Explain the reasoning behind each step
- Provide feedback for improvement rather than direct rewrites

### Communication Coach (`communication-coach.txt`)

A prompt focused on improving communication patterns by:

- Encouraging high-level summaries before diving into details
- Providing gentle reminders to stay concise
- Supporting natural conversation flow while maintaining clarity
